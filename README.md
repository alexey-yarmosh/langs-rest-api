|---|---|---|
|Node.js (NestJS)|1:28:38|- it took a lot of time and update of several `tsconfig.json` fields to copy `data.json` file during compilation.|
|Python (Django)|1:37:05|- initially after googling 'python django rest api' first link led me to the `django-rest-framework` which seems to be a child framework of `django`. As both of them serve one purpose you can spend some time before understand that you chose the wrong framework.<br>- after importing `Todo` class from `models.py` to file where `Todo` class was already presented error message told about maximum of stack size, not about duplication of classes.|
|Ruby (Rails)|1:26:48|- during the installation, after the first basic problem first stackoverflow answer led to the site which offered me to setup ruby on mac for a price of 7 to 37$. It seem weird for me to ask money for the bunch of cli commands. Luckily sibling link contained all required info.<br>- the idea of conventions is everywhere in the app, but that is the thing you learn once and use everywhere so overally the idea is nice. Moreover it provides you with a lot of nice features (e.g. autoimport).<br>- while adding a lot of optional stuff (mails, jobs, etc.), there is no `/services` folder by default. Starter guide offers us to write all service logic in the controller. Maybe that is so because of the MVC nature of the app.|
